## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned that I can't change color to images with the same code as I would change color to icons.


### Continued development

I would put another container class with a different name and put different value to max-width because in desktop version the sections are different width. That would make things easier and faster.



### Useful resources

- [Box-shadows](https://getcssscan.com/css-box-shadow-examples) - This website has nice box-shadow examples.
- [Fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/) - My favorite icons website.
